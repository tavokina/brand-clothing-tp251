        Notes:
            - The email is normalized via ``normalize_email`` (lowercases
              the domain part).
            - ``username`` is autofilled with the email if not explicitly
              passed in ``extra_fields``, since ``AbstractUser`` still
              defines a ``username`` field with a unique constraint.
            - The password is hashed via ``set_password``; it is never
              stored in plain text.

class User(AbstractUser):
    """
    Custom user model that authenticates via email instead of username.

    Extends Django's ``AbstractUser`` to add project-specific fields and
    swaps the login identifier from ``username`` to ``email`` (see
    ``USERNAME_FIELD`` below). The inherited ``username`` field is kept
    for compatibility but is not used for authentication; it is
    autopopulated with the user's email by ``CustomUserManager``.

    Attributes:
        email (EmailField): Unique email address. Used as the login
            identifier instead of username.
        age (PositiveSmallIntegerField): User's age. Optional
            (nullable and blank).
        marketing_opt_in (BooleanField): Whether the user has opted in
            to receive marketing communications. Defaults to False.
        instagram (TextField): User's Instagram handle or profile link.
            NOTE: this field has no ``blank=True``/``null=True``, so it
            is effectively required by forms/serializers unless a
            default is supplied — double-check this is intentional.
        phone_number (CharField): User's phone number, max length 20.
            Optional in forms (``blank=True``) but defaults to an
            empty string at the database level (not nullable).
        is_active (BooleanField): Overrides the default from
            ``AbstractUser``. Defaults to False, meaning newly created
            users are inactive until explicitly activated (e.g. via an
            email confirmation / activation flow).
        name (TextField): Free-text display name. Optional (blank=True).

    Class attributes:
        USERNAME_FIELD (str): Set to "email" — Django will use this
            field for authentication (login) instead of "username".
        REQUIRED_FIELDS (list): Empty — no extra fields (besides email
            and password) are prompted for when running
            ``manage.py createsuperuser``.
        objects (CustomUserManager): Custom manager handling email-based
            user/superuser creation.
